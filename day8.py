" Day 8
Given an array arr[] with N elements, the task is to find out the longest sub-array which has the shape of a mountain.
The Longest Peak consists of elements that are initially in ascending order until a peak element is reached and beyond the peak element all other elements of the sub-array are in decreasing order.

Input: arr = [2, 2, 2] 
Output: 0 
Explanation: 
No sub-array exists that shows the behaviour of a mountain sub-array.

Input: arr = [1, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5] 
Output: 11 

Explanation: 
There are two sub-arrays that can be considered as mountain sub-arrays. The first one is from index 0 â€“ 2 (3 elements) and next one is from index 2 â€“ 12 (11 elements).  As 11 > 2, our answer is 11.
